6)  The error is that the exceptions are unhandled if they were to be thrown.

7)  This fixed it because RuntimeExceptions do not need to be handled during runtime.
    Another thing we could have done was a try and catch block for each exception so they would be caught and handled.

9)  The circle is only printed when no exception occurs during the initilization of the circle. Otherwise, the exception
    is caught, handled, then, regardless if there was an exception or not, the code moves on to 'finally' and then
    prints "Done".

13) The error message appears after the code is halted for an unhandled exception, on the terminal.

14) Then any exceptions would be unhandled and your code would be halted.

15) "In finally." gets printed no matter what, but since return was called in catch, the function returns after finally,
    skipping "Done" entirely.
